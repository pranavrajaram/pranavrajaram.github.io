  <h1><b>My Portfolio</b></h1>
  <p>Hi there, my name is Pranav Rajaram, and I'm currently a sophomore attending Westford Academy. This website is a portfolio of sorts, with various collections of my work
  and some information about me. Some of my interests include football, data analysis, math, and football. I am well versed in programming languages R and Python, and
  enjoy statistics. </p>

Here is my final project for the DSC 80: Practice of Data Science Course at UC San Diego - [Lights Out: An Analysis of Power Outages](https://pranavrajaram.github.io/lights-out/)

I built a Random Forest Regression model with sklearn to analyze a dataset of power outages. I used techniques like one hot encoding, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize model predictions.

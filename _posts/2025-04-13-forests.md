title: Fire-Ready Forests Data Challenging

---

I competed in the 2025 Fire-Ready Forests Data Challenge. This competition, hosted by the ProWESS Center and the Wildfire Science & Technology Commons, aimed to enhance predictions of tree species, height, location, and other critical metrics to improve the ability of 3D physics-based fire models to accurately predict fire behavior and effects. I Used Aerial and Terrestrial Laser Scanning data to build 3-D Canopy Height Models, generate engineered treelists, and train machine learning models to predict tree species and forest attributes for wildfire simulation.

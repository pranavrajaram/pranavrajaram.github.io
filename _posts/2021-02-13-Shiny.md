Here are some links to a couple web apps I have made using the R library Shiny. They are all related to fantasy football.

<a href = "https://goprani04.shinyapps.io/Historical-Fantasy/" target = "_blank"> An app that shows the fantasy footballers leaders for every NFL season </a>
 - This app also gained some traction on the [fantasy football subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ikmwwx/i_built_a_web_app_that_allows_you_to_see_fantasy/)

<hr>

<a href = "https://goprani04.shinyapps.io/FantasyCompare/" target = "_blank"> An app to compare Fantasy Football scores from the 2019-20 NFL season</a>

<a href = "https://goprani04.shinyapps.io/2020ProjectionCompare/" target = "_blank"> An app to compare Fantasy Football projections for the 2020-21 NFL season </a>

*Note: the last two apps were both made in August 2020 ahead of the NFL season*

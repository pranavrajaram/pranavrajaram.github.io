<a href = "https://goprani04.shinyapps.io/Historical-Fantasy/" target = "_blank"> An app that shows the fantasy football leaders for every NFL season </a>

 - This app also gained some traction on the [fantasy football subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ikmwwx/i_built_a_web_app_that_allows_you_to_see_fantasy/)

<a href = "https://goprani04.shinyapps.io/nfldraft/" target = "_blank"> An app that shows draft classes for every NFL team since 1980 </a>

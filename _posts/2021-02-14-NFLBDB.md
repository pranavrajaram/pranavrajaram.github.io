Here is my submission for the NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 - [Scramble Drill](https://www.kaggle.com/pranavrajaram/scramble-drill)

# **Scramble Drill 🏈**

The scramble drill in the NFL is one of the most interesting plays there is. When the pocket collapses and pressure surrounds the quarterback, they are forced to "scramble" out of the pocket and improvise a play. It is the closest the NFL gets to backyard football. Some teams, such as the Seattle Seahawks, have [specific rules ](https://www.fieldgulls.com/football-breakdowns/2014/1/8/5267712/seahawks-saints-receivers-and-scramble-rules) that receivers have to follow when the quarterback rolls out.
> For the wide receivers, if your route is: <br>
TOO DEEP, come back to open grass <br>
DEEP, break opposite but don’t out run your QB’s ARM <br>
SHORT, go long keeping an eye on the QB <br>
MEDUIM, stay at your level and stay or get into QB’s view 

Quarterbacks like Russell Wilson, Patrick Mahomes, and Josh Allen have almost perfected the scramble drill and it is a large reason as to why they are among the best quarterbacks in the NFL. Here is an animation of an incredibly important scramble drill play from the 2018-19 season.

Faced with a 4th and 9 down 7 from their own 40 yard line, the Chiefs were in a bad spot. If they failed to convert this play, the Ravens would win the game and the Chiefs would no longer control their destiny for the #1 seed in the conference. Mahomes faced heavy pressure from Za'Darius Smith(#90) and Brandon Williams(#98). Speedy receiver Tyreek Hill, seeing that Mahomes was forced to roll out right, turned his route back towards the middle of the field. Mahomes heaved it into the waiting arms of Hill for a 48 yard completion that moved the chains. The Chiefs would go on to win the game, and eventually secured the 1 seed in the AFC.

This play is a perfect example of the importance of defending the scramble drill. Had the defender(C.J. Mosley) stuck with Hill as he improvised his route and forced an incompletion, the Chiefs would not have converted and would almost definitely have lost the game. The EPA(expected points added) of the play was 4.04, which was the 6th highest total among scramble drill plays all season.

Conversely, here's an example of a well defended scramble play.

Browns QB Baker Mayfield is forced to roll out left due to pressure from Jahleel Addae(#37), and throws it to receiver Jarvis Landry(#80). Defensive Back Desmond King(#20) sticks with Landry, and makes a good play on the ball to get an interception. This play led to a Chargers touchdown that put the game out of reach for Cleveland. It had an EPA of -6.38, meaning that this play added 6.38 points to the Chargers.

These examples show just how important scramble drills are for both sides of the football. Now, let's look at what teams and players did the best against these scramble plays.

- Note: I defined a "scramble play" as a play classified with typeDropback = "SCRAMBLE_ROLLOUT_LEFT" or typeDropback = "SCRAMBLE_ROLLOUT_RIGHT" in the provided plays dataset

## Best Teams
Here is a graph of every NFL team, and how well they defended scramble drill plays. The lower the EPA, the better they performed.
Green indicates a good EPA, and red indicates bad.

The Chargers, Falcons, and Lions headlined the best teams in defending the scramble drill, while the Ravens, Panthers, and Giants were among the worst.

## Best and Worst Players
Going a bit deeper, here were the best and worst players in the scramble drill from the 2018-19 NFL season. This data includes players who had at least 3 plays where they were the closest defender(<2.5 yards of separation) to the targeted receiver when the quarterback rolled out.

Malcolm Butler, Sharrod Neasman, and Eric Kendricks had the lowest EPA allowed when targeted on scramble plays, while Ron Parker, Marlon Humphrey, and Kendall Fuller had the highest.

Sometimes, a receiver makes an excellent play despite being closely guarded(like [here](https://www.miamidolphins.com/video/leonte-carroo-hauls-in-epic-74-yard-touchdown)), so to account for that, here are the 20 defenders that were closest on average to their man on scramble plays. Distance is in yards.

## *How can these findings be used in the NFL?*

- This information can help NFL front offices make decisions in the offseason, especially teams in a division with an elite scrambling quarterback. For example, the San Francisco 49ers might target safety Sharrod Neasman(2nd lowest EPA allowed in scramble drill, 9th closest defender on average) to help defend against the likes of Kyler Murray and Russell Wilson.  

- These same teams could also make hiring decisions based on this info. Gus Bradley, the LA Chargers' defensive coordinator, could be sought out by teams needing help in defending scramble drills(like the Panthers), as he coached the unit that allowed the lowest average EPA on scramble plays. 

- Teams could use this information when preparing for gameday. Coaches could tell the QB to target defenders with a high EPA allowed when they are scrambling out to help maximize the success of the play. They could also do the opposite, and tell the QB to avoid a certain defender depending on his strength in defending scramble drills.

- It also could help players improve as well. Those who did not perform as well in the scramble drill might work on it in the off-season and elevate their play to a higher level.
